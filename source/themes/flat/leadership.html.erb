        <p class="lead">I have a Purpose - - To Teach; To Train; To Build Up God’s Kingdom</p>

        <p class="lead">I have a Prayer - - That God would daily use me as HIS instrument</p>

        <p> Whenever asked “What do you want to be when you grow up?” – I always answered with a God-given confidence -
          “A Missionary Teacher that tells boys and girls about Jesus!” God gave me that vision when I was just a little
          girl – but He’s grown that vision over many years. It’s been an exciting journey with God – through Bible
          School training and through missionary work being done in Edinburgh, Scotland; Liverpool, England and Tucson,
          AZ. For over 40 years now, He has enabled me to learn from, teach, mentor, train, disciple, counsel,
          evangelize and encourage children, youth and adults. Currently I am the Director of Word of Truth Ministries –
          a Bible Correspondence Discipleship School for children and youth. June 1, 2015 I began the position at TCCC
          as the Director of Children’s and Youth Ministry. Daily I watch God renew His vision within my heart. I watch
          as He enables me to fulfill the purpose He has called me to. And I watch, as well as stand in awe at, the
          amazing answers to prayer that He bestows. To God be the glory!!
